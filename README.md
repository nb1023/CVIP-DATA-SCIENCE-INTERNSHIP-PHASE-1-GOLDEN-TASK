# Diabetes Prediction System using SVM (Support Vector Machine)

The Diabetes Prediction System is an application designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on their input features. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM), we can provide accurate predictions.

# Features
User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for seamless user experience.
Data preprocessing utilizing StandardScaler for standardized input data.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for diabetes prediction.

Run the application file:
streamlit run main.py
